# Search Engine from Scratch
This was an individual project as part of the DD2477 Search Engines and Information Retrieval Systems course at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

Built upon provided skeleton code from the course, I implemented full indexing (including merging disk indexing) and retrieval logic, including:
- Boolean queries (intersect, phrase, union)
- Ranked retrieval with TF-IDF, PageRank, HITS (Hubs and Authorities)
- KGram index and wildcard queries
- Spelling correction for single- and multiword queries
